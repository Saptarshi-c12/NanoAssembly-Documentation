!!! success "Who are we ?" 
    The Nano-Assembly team closely collaborates with all other teams at C12. To put it in a simple way, our goal is to assemble the devices for the measurement team by depositing a carbon nanotube (CNT) of choice onto the chip of choice. 

## Process
The growth team is in charge of producing the CNTs for the production and the development stages. Currently, there are two different systems on which CNTs are grown:

    CADs (that are a single chip terminating with a series of cantilevers) and SADs (that can potentially host significantly more CNTS, as they are chips with several series of slits/grids systems).
