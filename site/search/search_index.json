We have a rough pump (Back) prepumping the turbo pump (Turbo) and we have a rough pump (Rough) dedicated to create the low vacuum in the assembler. Pumps are always all on, we just close valves between Rough and assembler and between Turbo and assembler, depending on the operation.  From the jbox (controlling all valves on the system), switch rough on (back should  be on, with gate off) When pressure reaches 10^-1 hPa, switch the gate to on. Switch off rough. When the assembler is normaly pumped down, there should be back and gate switched on. Check the alignment of chip wirebonds (with the Efitor)  We use the contacts b and d (a and c are for measurement team) Create device on database and add the connection maps (if this is the first time we use the design), e.g. CS, S, G1-5, D, CD\u2026 and corresponding names on the bond map side.  This should become obsolete when the chip design team will start to automatically create wirebonding maps in the future, but it\u2019s good practice to doublecheck the wirebonds.

The automatic approach (using the attocubes) automatically decreases z by a fixed amount, while the current between CS and S and CD and D is measured, to see if touchdown has occured. When the current increases above a certain treshold, the approach automatically interrupts.  Touchdown might occur at the same time at both electrodes, or only at one side.  Ground all connections on the matrix Disconnect all connections on the matrix Do chip health test, after switching off the microscope light, Depending on what you see (contacts at both electrodes, at one electrode, shortings, collapses\u2026) you can do different operations: do I-V curve (this informs you on the quality of the contact you have between CNT and electrode, and possibly on the type of tube). Typical initial bias voltages are 1.5-2 V, not to push the CNT too much. You can decide to: Current anneal the tube further, by repeating the I-V curve while using a larger voltage range. Usually 8-9 V is when things get too harsh on the tube, and collpse events become more probable. Do gate dependance tests (i.e. scan the voltage applied to a gate while measuring the current through the CNT at a fixes S-D voltage. cut the tube already (whether the cutting happens mechanically or electrically depends on the specific electrode design/material. If the resistance of the electrodes is too high (of the order of 100 MOhm), you would need to apply a cutting voltage that would cause the CNT to collapse on the gates   ii. make another step down, and in case repeat the procedure done so far.

Check all channels in Matrix are grounded from software  Attach connectors (Nano-Ds) at the back of the sampleholder after removing the shorting caps from it. Each connector has 25 lines. There is only one way to insert the connectors, so it should not possible to invert them. Mount fork on the SWAN (by screwing what are we screwing here???)

Do a first chip health test to make sure there are no shorts Check electrodes and gates from SEM/RABIES/optical microscope (if existing) results to have an idea of potential issues Choose CNT from charac report sheets Pick Approach SWAN (i.e. fork) to CAD  Bring microscope in by using its controller (it\u2019s done manually at the moment) - to be made semiautomatic After having decided what CNT to staple, focus the microscope on the correct cantilever (count by hand) Check what is the distance between the end of the cantillevers and th eposition of the chosen CNT. In defining the starting posiiton of the fork, remember that you need to also correct for the angle on the CNT on the cantilever (i.e. if there is an angle, the fork needs to be further in than the central posiiton of the CNT). Start the coarse approach of the fork to the CAD. When you are close enough, choose the automatic approach to start going down. The automatic approach (using the attocubes) automatically decreases z by a fixed amount, while the current on the fork is measured, to see if contact has been made. When the current increases above a certain threshold, the approach automatically interrupts.  Contact might occur at the same time at both electrodes, or only at one side.  Ground all connections on the matrix Disconnect all connections on the matrix. Check I-V curve on the CNT by passing some current rhough the CNT. This is usually a relatively conservative step, not to ruin the CNT. I-V curves can be done one after another at slightly increasingly voltages (usually still below 3-5 V) to see if current annealing improves the properties of the tube. If the CNT has interesting I-V dependance, you can retract the fork; the CNT should remain on the fork. If the CNT is not interested, \u201cburn\u201d it off the fork by passing a high current through it (10-15 V). In either case, depending on what you want to see, retract the fork afterwards and check again I-V to verify whether the CNT is still there or not. Place Approach the SWAN (i.e. fork + CNT) to chip (and specifically to the chosen device) Bring microscope in by using its controller (it\u2019s done manually at the moment) - to be made semiautomatic Focus the microscope on the chip to make sure that everything is ok with it. Then, bring the fork in. Check the alignment of the fork with the device. Start the coarse approach of the fork to the chip until the alignment between device and cantilever spacing is good  When you are close enough (check the shadow of the thines against the device, and the alignment of the end of the fork with the electrodes), choose the automatic approach to start going down. The automatic approach (using the attocubes) automatically decreases z by a fixed amount, while the current on the fork is measured, to see if contact has been made. When the current increases above a certain threshold, the approach automatically interrupts.  Contact might occur at the same time at both electrodes, or only at one side.  Ground all connections on the matrix Disconnect all connections on the matrix. Check I-V curve on the CNT by passing some current rhough the CNT.  Do gate dependance as well Do chip health test, after switching off the microscope light, Depending on what you see (contacts at both electrodes, at one electrode, shortings, collapses\u2026) you can do different operations: do I-V curve (this informs you on the quality of the contact you have between CNT and electrode, and possibly on the type of tube). Typical initial bias voltages are 1.5-2 V, not to push the CNT too much. You can decide to: Current anneal the tube further, by repeating the I-V curve while using a larger voltage range. Usually 8-9 V is when things get too harsh on the tube, and collpse events become more probable. Do gate dependance tests (i.e. scan the voltage applied to a gate while measuring the current through the CNT at a fixes S-D voltage. cut the tube already (whether the cutting happens mechanically or electrically depends on the specific electrode design/material. If the resistance of the electrodes is too high (of the order of 100 MOhm), you would need to apply a cutting voltage that would cause the CNT to collapse on the gates   ii. make another step down, and in case repeat the procedure done so far.</p> <p>## Visual Representation</p>"},{"location":"hardware/issue/","title":"Hardware Constrainsts","text":"<p>This is the list of the operations on or with the Hardware where the user (during manual control) and the Software (During Automation process) need to take into account to protect the system from any accidental damages.</p> Task Critical Operation Cannot Run Parallel with (Hard) Hardware Zoom/ AutoFocus If The Microscope is moving in Z axis The Microscope cannot Go in X-Y Axis Microscope If the Microscope is moving in X-Y Axis The Microscope cannot go in Z direction SWAN Movement To Move, First move the Attocube in the X-Y and then the Z position AttoCube Motors To Move-back, First move to the Z axis and then the X-Y axis For ARUN motors, First move in the Z axis and then the X-Y axis ARUN Motors To Move-back, First move to the X-Y axis and then move to the Z axis SMU Operations Changes in Compliance Current/Voltage by different GUIs (eg.
